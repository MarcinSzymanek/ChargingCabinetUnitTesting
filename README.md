## This project demonstrates unit testing of a Cabinet-charging system. 

A typical use case goes as follows:
1. User opens the cabinet door
2. User connects his phone to the charger inside the cabinet
3. User closes the door
4. User scans his RFID - card at the scanner 
5. System locks the door and charging begins
6. When user wants to retrieve his phone, he scans his RFID -card again and opens the door
7. In case a different RFID-id is scanned, the door remains locked
8. In case of charging error, the system stops charging
9. Messages are displayed on the display throughout the use case
